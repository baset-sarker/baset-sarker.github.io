                          <!-- <p>
                            I'm Md Abdul Baset Sarker, a dedicated researcher and engineer in Electrical and Computer Engineering, currently pursuing my PhD at Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York. Originally from Bangladesh, my journey began with a solid foundation in Electronics and Communication Engineering. My doctoral research focuses on Machine Vision and Artificial Intelligence, addressing real-world challenges through projects like vision-enabled prosthetic hands, exoskeleton and AI-based underwater microplastic detection systems. Alongside my academic pursuits, I have six years of industrial experience, I have served as a Senior Software Engineer, leading teams and contributing to innovative solutions across diverse domains.
                            <br>
                            I've been honored with awards such as the President's Challenge at Clarkson University and Employee of the Month at PRAN-RFL Group, motivating me to continue pushing the boundaries of engineering. Passionate about sharing knowledge, my research interests span various topics, reflecting my commitment to advancing scientific knowledge and driving innovation. As I look ahead, I'm eager to continue making meaningful contributions to Electrical and Computer Engineering, armed with academic rigor, technical expertise, and a relentless drive to innovate.
