# An Open-Source Face-Aware Capture System  

## Abstract  
Poor-quality facial images present challenges in biometric authentication, particularly for passport photo acquisition and recognition. This paper proposes an open-source, real-time facial image quality analysis system utilizing computer vision on a low-power Jetson-based hardware platform. The system includes a Jetson processor, a 16 MP autofocus camera, a touchscreen LCD, and AES encryption for secure image storage. Through pilot data collection, the system demonstrated 98.98% accuracy in capturing high-quality images. This cost-effective and customizable solution has potential applications in passport verification, security, and identity verification systems.  

## Project Description  
The proposed **Face-Aware Capture System** consists of the following components:  
- **Hardware:** Jetson Nano, 16 MP autofocus camera, touchscreen LCD.  
- **Software:** Image quality assessment algorithms to evaluate geometric, pose, and photographic features in real-time.  
- **Encryption:** AES-128 encryption secures stored images.  
- **Validation:** The system was tested against the U.S. Travel passport image check website, achieving a high acceptance rate (98.98% accuracy).  
- **Open-source:** The projectâ€™s hardware and software designs are publicly available for customization and deployment.  

## System Overview  
1. The user positions themselves in front of the camera.  
2. The system captures and evaluates multiple images for quality.  
3. The best images are presented for selection.  
4. The selected image is encrypted and securely stored.  
5. The system ensures compliance with **ISO/IEC-19794-5** biometric standards.

## Results  
- **Pilot Study:** Conducted with 39 participants, capturing over 6000 images.  
- **Quality Validation:** 98.98% accuracy in producing passport-compliant images.  
- **Processing Time:** Jetson Nano processes frames in **0.075s per image**.  

## Conclusion  
This research introduces an efficient and secure **face-aware capture system** that enhances image quality for biometric applications. By leveraging **real-time quality assessment, ISO standards, and AES encryption**, the system ensures high accuracy and security. Future improvements may include **automatic height adjustment, deep learning-based quality assessment, and background separation techniques**.
